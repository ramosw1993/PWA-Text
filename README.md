# 19 Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## Description

My task was to build a text editor that runs in the browser using PWA, the application will consist of not only the PWA criteerias but also has a number of data techniques that will help with options that the browser does not support. This application also works when there is no internet.

The application was also deployed on Heroku and serves as a functional text editor. I had a great experience building this application, however, I now know that I will not be a PWA developer but this is one of the toughest concepts to grasp.

## Installation/ Usage

This is a web based application, no installation is required. Works as your standard web editor, write in the text field and the work will save automatically.
